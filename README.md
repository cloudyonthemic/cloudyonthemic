# Hey, Welcome or Whatever

This is my GitHub. I put stuff here sometimes. Most of it probably doesn't work.

- I code things
- Sometimes I forget to update stuff
- If you see something broken, it's intentional
- I have around 47 unfinished projects and counting


## About Me

I like sprite and naps. Sometimes I write code. That's all you get.

## Contact

Nope.

## Fun Fact

There is no fun fact. This section exists purely to disappoint you.
